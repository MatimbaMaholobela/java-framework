*ForkJoin.java  --It takes an array of type float, boundaries( low and high)
				-- ForkJoin(float [] arr, int low, int high)
				-- it performs median filter where the median is writtern in a file stored in the OutputFiles
					*the file name depends on the inputfile if input_file = sampleInput100.txt
											               then outputfile = sampleOutput100.txt
												       


ReadFile.java  	--takes in a file of float numbers as parameters and returns an array of the type float

ForkJoinRun	   	-- It contains the main method where the ForkJoin is ran.

				***** Enter filename space filter size

					  e.g sampleInput1000.txt 3

				--it is run by "make forkjoin" on the terminal


NormalRun 		--contains the main methid where median filter is performed without parallelism.

				***** Enter filename space filter size

					  e.g sampleInput1000.txt 3

				--it is run by "make normal" on the terminal
